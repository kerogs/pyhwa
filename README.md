## How to install
If you want to create a shortcut on your desktop, you can create a shortcut to PyHwa.exe

> [!NOTE]
> You need to have Python (for the server) and NodeJS (for the front-end) installed on your machine!

### Quick installation
* Click on the file ``PyHwa.exe``.
    the file will take care of installing the dependencies and also the required NPM packages. If this has already been done, it will just launch the server.

### Manual installation
1. Clone repository
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/kerogs/PyHwaer.git
    ```
1. Installing NPM packages *(at the root and in the static folder)*
    ```sh
    npm i;cd static; npm i
    ```
1. download python requirements
    ```sh
    pip 
    ```


## How to use
### With exe
* Click on the file ``PyHwa.exe``.
### With CLI
```sh
py .\app.py
```

## How to add manhwa/manhua/manga
Everything must be put in the ``/static/content`` folder.

You must respect this tree structure for it to work properly
- ``/static/content/[manga]/[chapter]/[allImage]``

Example :
```tree
📦content
 ┣ 📂Arafoo Otoko no Isekai Tsuhan Seikatsu
 ┃ ┣ 📂Chapter 1
 ┃ ┃ ┣ 📜01.jpg
 ┃ ┃ ┣ 📜02.jpg
 ┃ ┃ ┣ 📜03.jpg
 ┃ ┃ ┣ 📜04.jpg
 ┃ ┃ ┣ ...
 ┃ ┣ 📂Chapter 2
 ┃ ┃ ┣ 📜01.jpg
 ┃ ┃ ┣ 📜02.jpg
 ┃ ┃ ┣ 📜03.jpg
 ┃ ┃ ┣ 📜04.jpg
 ┃ ┃ ┗ ...
 ┃ ...
 ┗ 📜 .gitkeep
```

> [!NOTE]
> For the chapter numbering, you can name it as you wish, but it's highly recommended to keep to the format used in the example for the moment.
